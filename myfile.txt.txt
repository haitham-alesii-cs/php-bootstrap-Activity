Data types that are defined by system are called primitive data types.
The primitive data types provided by many programming languages are: int, float, char, double, bool, etc. 
The number of bits allocated for each primitive data type depends on the programming languages
the compiler and the operating system.
For the same primitive data type, different languages may use different sizes.
depending on the size of the data types, the total available values (domain) will also change.
